# Definició de la màquina mínima per executar node amb versió LTS
# This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to
# run node. Unless you are working in an environment where only the Node.js image will be deployed and you have space
# constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this repository.
box: node:8.14.1-slim
build:
  steps:
# This step will download the specified version of Hugo and run this over the source code to generate the static version of
# your site. This can then automatically be deployed using other steps.
# Since version 1.9.0, the step has the latest two versions of Hugo already installed thereby skipping the download part of
# the step.
    - arjen/hugo-build:
# Specifies the version of Hugo to be used, by default this is "0.30.2". It is recommended to set this, so you don't
# accidentally build you site with a version it isn't ready for. Due to Wercker not being able to properly handle 0.x version
# numbers, you will need to put quotes around the version number.
